<p><ul><li>Shouldered Eye Bolts</li><li>Non-Shouldered Eye Bolts</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Welded eye bolts can be categorized into two main types: shouldered eye bolts and non-shouldered eye bolts. Shouldered eye bolts have a shoulder under the eye that provides added strength and support. These are suitable for heavy-duty applications where the load may be at an angle to the bolt. Non-shouldered eye bolts, on the other hand, do not have a shoulder and are used in applications where a flush finish or a lower profile is required. Both types serve different purposes and are chosen based on specific application requirements.</p></p>
