<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The DR Detector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Indirect DR Detector</li><li>Direct DR Detector</li></ul></p>
<p><p>DR Detector Market Types refer to the two main categories of digital radiography detectors available in the market. Indirect DR Detectors use a scintillator to convert X-rays into light, which is then converted into a digital image by a sensor. Direct DR Detectors, on the other hand, directly convert X-rays into digital images using a flat panel detector. Each type has its own advantages and disadvantages in terms of image quality, speed, and cost, making them suitable for different applications in the healthcare industry.</p></p>
