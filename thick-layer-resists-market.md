<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thick Layer Resists Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Resists</li><li>Negative Resists</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Thick layer resists are commonly used in the semiconductor industry for photolithography processes. Positive resists are sensitive to light and become more soluble when exposed, allowing the unexposed areas to be removed during development. Negative resists, on the other hand, become less soluble when exposed to light, making the exposed areas remain intact after development. Both positive and negative resists cater to different needs in the market, with positive resists being more commonly used for thick layer applications.</p></p>
