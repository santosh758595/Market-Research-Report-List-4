<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rotary Screw Compressors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Oil-free</li><li>Oil-injected</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Rotary screw compressors can be classified into two main types based on the use of oil: oil-free and oil-injected compressors. Oil-free compressors are designed for applications where oil contamination is not acceptable, such as in food and pharmaceutical industries. These compressors use special coatings and materials to ensure no oil contacts the compressed air. On the other hand, oil-injected compressors use oil for lubrication and cooling purposes, making them more suitable for industrial applications where oil contamination is not a concern.</p></p>
