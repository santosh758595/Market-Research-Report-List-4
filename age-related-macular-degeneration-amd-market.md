<p><ul><li>Wet AMD</li><li>Dry AMD</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a condition that affects the center of the retina, leading to vision loss. There are two main types of AMD - wet AMD and dry AMD. Wet AMD is characterized by abnormal blood vessel growth in the retina, leading to rapid and severe vision loss. Dry AMD, on the other hand, is caused by the gradual breakdown of light-sensitive cells in the macula. Both types of AMD can significantly impact a person's quality of life and may require different treatment approaches.</p></p>
