<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wearable Cardiac Monitors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electric Pulse Based</li><li>Optical Technology Based</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electric Pulse Based wearable cardiac monitors work by measuring the electrical activity of the heart through sensors placed on the body. This type of monitor is usually more accurate in detecting irregular heart rhythms. On the other hand, Optical Technology Based monitors use light sensors to track changes in blood flow, which can indicate heart rate and blood pressure. These monitors are non-invasive and can provide continuous monitoring without the need for electrodes or leads. Both types offer convenient and reliable ways to monitor cardiac health.</p></p>
