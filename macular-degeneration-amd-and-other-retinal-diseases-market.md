<p><p>Macular Degeneration (AMD) is a common condition that affects the central part of the retina, leading to vision loss. Diabetic Macular Edema and Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) are retinal diseases caused by diabetes that can also result in vision impairment. Retinal Vein Occlusion occurs when a vein in the retina becomes blocked, affecting blood flow and vision. Wet Age-Related Macular Degeneration (wAMD) involves abnormal blood vessel growth in the retina, while Dry Age-Related Macular Degeneration (dAMD) is characterized by the deterioration of the macula. Other retinal diseases encompass a range of conditions affecting the retina and can also result in vision loss.</p></p>
