<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Carbon Bearings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rolling Bearing</li><li>Plain Bearing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Carbon bearings are commonly classified into two main types: rolling bearings and plain bearings. Rolling bearings are designed to handle radial and axial loads by using rolling elements such as balls or rollers. They are commonly used in applications where high precision and high speed are required. On the other hand, plain bearings rely on a sliding motion between the bearing surface and the shaft for support. They are ideal for applications where heavy loads and slow speeds are present, such as in machines and engines.</p></p>
