<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Stationary Impact Crushers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Horizontal Shaft Impact</li><li>Vertical Shaft Impact</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Stationary impact crushers are categorized into two main types: horizontal shaft impact crushers and vertical shaft impact crushers. </p><p>Horizontal shaft impact crushers are designed to crush materials through a high-speed rotor that impacts the feeding material. </p><p>Vertical shaft impact crushers use a different approach, as they utilize a high-speed rotor with wear-resistant tips to crush materials against a crushing chamber. </p><p>Both types of crushers are stationary, meaning they are fixed in one place and do not have mobility like mobile impact crushers.</p></p>
