<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automated Ophthalmic Perimeters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Static Ophthalmic Perimeters</li><li>Kinetic Ophthalmic Perimeters</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automated ophthalmic perimeters are devices used to test the visual field of patients. There are two main types of automated ophthalmic perimeters: static and kinetic. </p><p>Static ophthalmic perimeters use stationary light stimuli to map out a patient's visual field. This type of test is useful for detecting subtle changes in the visual field.</p><p>Kinetic ophthalmic perimeters, on the other hand, use moving stimuli to measure the boundaries of a patient's visual field. This type of test is more effective at detecting larger or more advanced visual field defects.</p></p>
