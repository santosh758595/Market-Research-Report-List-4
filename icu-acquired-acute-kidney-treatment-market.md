<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The ICU-acquired Acute Kidney Treatment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pre-renal</li><li>Intrinsic-renal</li><li>Post-renal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>ICU-acquired Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) can be classified into three types based on the underlying cause: Pre-renal, Intrinsic-renal, and Post-renal. Pre-renal AKI occurs due to decreased blood flow to the kidneys, often caused by dehydration or decreased cardiac output. Intrinsic-renal AKI results from direct damage to the kidney tissue, commonly from infections or toxins. Post-renal AKI is caused by obstruction in the urinary tract, preventing the flow of urine from the kidneys. Each type of AKI requires different treatment approaches to prevent further kidney damage and improve patient outcomes.</p></p>
