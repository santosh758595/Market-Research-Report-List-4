<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cardiopulmonary Autotransfusion Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Unwashed ATS</li><li>Washed ATS</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cardiopulmonary Autotransfusion Systems (ATS) are medical devices used to collect, process, and reinfuse a patient's own blood during surgery. There are two main types of ATS: Unwashed ATS and Washed ATS. Unwashed ATS involves collecting blood from the surgical field and reinfusing it without processing. Washed ATS, on the other hand, involves washing the collected blood to remove any impurities before reinfusion. Both types of ATS help reduce the need for donor blood transfusions and minimize the risk of complications during surgery.</p></p>
