<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The SPECT Camera Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gamma Ray</li><li>X Ray</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The SPECT Camera market consists of two main types: Gamma Ray and X Ray. Gamma Ray cameras utilize gamma radiation to create images of internal organs and tissues in the body, allowing for clear visualization of abnormalities and diseases. X Ray cameras, on the other hand, use X-ray radiation to capture detailed images of bones and tissues, aiding in the diagnosis of fractures, tumors, and other conditions. Both types of cameras play a crucial role in medical imaging and diagnostics.</p></p>

<p><strong>The SPECT Camera Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Scintigraphy</li><li>Tomography</li></ul></p>
<p><p>SPECT cameras are used in the medical field for scintigraphy, which involves detecting gamma rays emitted by a radioactive tracer to create images of internal organs or tissues. Tomography is a technique that allows for the visualization of a single plane of an object by blurring out the images of other planes. In the market, SPECT cameras are essential tools for diagnosing conditions such as cancer, heart disease, and neurological disorders through scintigraphy and tomography imaging techniques.</p></p>
