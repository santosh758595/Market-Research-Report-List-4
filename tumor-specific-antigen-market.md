<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tumor-Specific Antigen Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Coding Region</li><li>Non-Coding Region</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Tumor-specific antigens can be classified into two main types based on their location in the genetic code: coding region and non-coding region. Coding region tumor-specific antigens are derived from the protein-coding genes and include mutated proteins that are specific to tumor cells. On the other hand, non-coding region tumor-specific antigens are derived from non-coding regions of the genome and include mutated RNA or DNA sequences that are unique to tumor cells. Both types of tumor-specific antigens play a crucial role in cancer immunotherapy and targeted treatment strategies.</p></p>
