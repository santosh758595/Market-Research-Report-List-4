<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical Mechanical Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-invasive Ventilator</li><li>Invasive Ventilator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Medical Mechanical Ventilators are devices used to support patients who are unable to breathe on their own. The market for these devices can be classified into two main types: Non-invasive ventilators and Invasive ventilators. Non-invasive ventilators deliver airflow to the lungs without the need for intubation, making them suitable for patients with less severe respiratory issues. Invasive ventilators, on the other hand, require intubation and deliver airflow directly into the lungs, making them more appropriate for patients with more critical respiratory conditions.</p></p>
